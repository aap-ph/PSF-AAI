        The Philippine Skills Framework (PSF) Initiative is a Philippine government inter-agency effort to build the skills and competencies of the country’s human capital and to better prepare the workforce for the future economy, particularly for Industry 4.0. The PSF Initiative’s Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) were signed by ten departments and agencies, namely the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Department of Tourism (DOT) and the Department of Agriculture (DA). The PSF Initiative prioritizes the construction, creatives, food (agriculture and fishery), health and wellness, IT-BPM (Information Technology and Business Process Management), logistics and supply chain, manufacturing, and tourism industries.

        The Philippine Skills Framework for Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (PSF-AAI) is an endeavor developed for the Philippine workforce of all industries to address skills mastery and continuous learning in the AAI Sector. It is a collaborative development effort initiated and spearheaded by the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT) and the Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Association of the Philippines (AAP), in cooperation with the stakeholders of the Philippine AAI field, i.e., employers, practitioners, education and training providers.

        These verticals were chosen by Philippine AAI subject matter experts and consultants after meticulously reviewing the current analytics and AI landscape of the Philippines together with current trends in demand and supply (both locally and internationally) in the sector.These verticals were chosen by Philippine AAI subject matter experts and consultants after meticulously reviewing the current analytics and AI landscape of the Philippines together with current trends in demand and supply (both locally and internationally) in the sector.

        This PSF is a result of a thorough conduct of studies, desk research, and review. The PSF-AAI methodology consisted of reviewing AAP’s Professional Maturity Model (which was derived from the 2017 APEC Project DARE or Data Analytics Raising Employment project), as well as the results of the 2022 Labor Market Intelligence Report on the Analytics Sector which was created as part of Philippine Business for Education (PBEd) A Future That Works program, a workforce development initiative supported by the Australian Government. This was followed by the formation of various teams including: the Contextualizers who reviewed the Singapore Skills Framework (as the primary reference), the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA), and Job and Skills Australia (JSA) to adapt them to Philippine industry scenarios; and the Validators from the government, the private sector, academe, and practitioners who worked together to ascertain the validity of the draft PSF-AAI framework to local best practices but still allowing for the development of a globally competitive Philippine workforce in AAI. After several drafts and the concurrence of the government representatives, consultants, and resource persons, the PSF-AAI Version 1.0 was created, approved, and finally launched in May 2024.
